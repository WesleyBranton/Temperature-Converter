# Temperature Converter [<img align="right" src=".github/fxaddon.png">](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/temperature-converter-tool/)
Nearly half of the worldâ€™s population has access to the internet from hundreds of countries. The internet is the largest global knowledge base and community, but some users may have issues with measurement units that are not commonly used in their region. In order to fully appreciate and comprehend the countless amounts of data that are displayed on the World Wide Web, users need to see these measurements in units which they can fully understand and relate to.

The most common measurement which internet users like to see converted to their local unit is temperature. People frequently find a need to convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit. To do so, they will often resort to an online temperature conversion website.

But what if there was a way to convert your temperatures directly from Firefox? Well now there is!

The Temperature Converter is the first Firefox add-on that allows you go quickly convert onscreen temperatures without any external navigation. Simply highlight the temperature with the mouse cursor and use the convenient context menu button to display the temperature in either Celsius or Fahrenheit.
